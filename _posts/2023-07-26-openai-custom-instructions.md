# OpenAI's Latest Custom Instructions Feature

OpenAI has recently introduced a new feature called 'Custom Instructions' for its language model, GPT-3. This feature allows users to provide specific instructions to the model, guiding its behavior throughout the conversation.

The custom instructions feature is a powerful tool that can be used to tailor the AI's responses to specific needs. It can be used to specify the format of the response, the level of detail, the tone, and much more.

Highlights of this new feature:
- Control the format of the AI's responses.	- Specify the level of detail in the AI's responses.
- Guide the AI's tone and style of responses.
- Influence the AI's behavior throughout the conversation.

- Adapt the AI to specific use cases.

- Expand the AI's capabilities to meet user needs.

To use the custom instructions feature, users simply provide a set of instructions at the beginning of the conversation. These instructions are then used by the AI to guide its responses throughout the conversation.

Overall, the custom instructions feature is a significant step forward in the development of AI technology. It provides users with a greater level of control and customization, enabling more effective and efficient use of AI in a wide range of applications.
